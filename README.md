# QuakeTools

Little tool(s) made with my crappy programming to aid Quake 1 mapping. Lightstyle Viewer is the only tool right now.

## [Lightstyle Viewer](https://ronroniv.github.io/QuakeTools/lightstyle_viewer/)
You can preview default lightstyles and test custom style.

### TODO:
* Visualizer and visual editor (#1)
* Beautify
* Prevent entering non-alphabet to input field for custom style

### Why?
Mostly for fun. It's not like this kind of tool has been sorely needed for me or, I guess, Quake mappers in general, but this just seemed like a good opportunity for me to practicing tool development and javascript.

### Credits
* Made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and p5.dom.js.
* Cube texture is from Quake.
