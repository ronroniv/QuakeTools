# QuakeTools

Little tool(s) made with my crappy programming to aid Quake 1 mapping. Lightstyle Viewer is the only tool right now.

## [Lightstyle Viewer](https://ronroniv.github.io/QuakeTools/lightstyle_viewer/)
You can preview default lightstyles and test custom style.

### TODO:
* GUI editor & visualizer?
* Beautify
* Prevent entering non-alphabet to input field for custome style

### Credits
Made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and p5.dom.js.
